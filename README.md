## Setting Up

### Hardware and OS

+ Hardware: Audio I/O is required. (PC with microphones and speakers)
+ OS: Linux and Mac OS X
    + The system has been originally developed on Linux Mint.
    + It would be also easy to build the system on other Debian-based distributions including Ubuntu.
    + It may also be possible to build the system on other kind of distributions e.g. Fedora, but I have not verified it yet.
    + I have successfully built the codes on Mac OS X (Yosemite) using `clang++`

### Libraries

You need to install following softwares first.

    g++
    tcl/tk
    PortAudio (libportaudio-dev)
    fftw3 (libfftw3-dev)

### Build

Just run the `makefile` in `src`

    cd src
    make
    cd -

### Usage

- Buy a 3.5mm-3.5mm audio cable.
- Make your audio player (such as iPod) ready.
- Connect one end of the cable to your audio player's output jack (3.5mm earphone jack), and the oppisite end to your PC's audio input jack.
- Run the system by the command below.

    ./euterpe
